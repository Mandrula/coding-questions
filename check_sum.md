Given a specific number (let's call it `n`) and an array of numbers (let's call it `numbers`)
write some code that returns a `Boolean`, indicating if there is a pair of numbers in numbers
that together add up to n.

e.g.: `n = 12, numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] -> true` (because 5 + 7 == 12)

e.g.2.: `n = 20, numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6] -> false`
