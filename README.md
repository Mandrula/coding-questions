A collection of problems and questions for the Hiring Process

## Email contact

The following snippet is the current email we send to candidates for the first time.

```
Hey <candidate's Name>,

I have a few questions for you, so we get to know you a bit more:

What’s your proudest achievement? It can be a personal project or
something you’ve worked on professionally. Just a short paragraph is fine,
but I’d love to know why you’re proud of it.

Tell me about a technical book or article you read recently, why you liked it,
and why I should read it.

Lastly, 2 small coding questions. For each of these, the solution should be
submitted in the form of a gist on gist.github.com. The implementation can be
done in any language, but it's important that the code is treated and designed
as if it was going to production.
It should include everything you think is necessary to explain the solution,
such as class definitions, documentation, tests, etc.



1. Write some code, that will flatten an array of arbitrarily nested arrays of
integers into a flat array of integers. e.g. [[1,2,[3]],4] -> [1,2,3,4].


2. Given a specific number (let's call it `n`) and an array of numbers
(let's call it `numbers`) write some code that returns a Boolean, indicating
if there is a pair of numbers in `numbers` that together add up to `n`.

e.g.: n = 12, numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] -> true (because 5 + 7 == 12)
e.g.2.: n = 20, numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6] -> false


Best,
```
