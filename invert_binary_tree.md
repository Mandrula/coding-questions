Write some code, that will invert a binary tree. (e.g Lets use JSON representation of a tree for explanation purposes)

```json
{ "root": "Root", "left_leaf": "left", "right_leaf": "right" }
```

should produce a tree which is represented by the following JSON

```json
{ "root": "Root", "left_leaf": "right", "right_leaf": "right" }
```
