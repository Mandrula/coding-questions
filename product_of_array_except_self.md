Given an array of n integers where _n > 1_, `nums`, return an array `output` such that `output[i]`
is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except `nums[i]`.

Solve it **without division** and leave a comment with the time complexity of your algorithm.

For example, given `[1,2,3,4]`, return `[24,12,8,6]`.
